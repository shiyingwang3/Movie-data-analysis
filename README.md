# Movie-data-analysis

In this project, we'll be analyzing data set that contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

In particular, we'll be interested in finding:

which genres are most popular from year to year
what kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues.

We'll use the python libraries Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

After completing the project, you will:

*Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
*Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
*Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
*Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
*Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
*Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
