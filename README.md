# Movie-data-analysis

In this project, we'll be analyzing data set that contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

In particular, we'll be interested in finding:

which genres are most popular from year to year
what kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues.
